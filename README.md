# "Isolation of zinc resistant Bacteria": 

The project aim is try to understand zinc resistance. Is it found in other strains or species in the German byte? Is it related to these previously examined diatom interactions? As such, water samples from different sites were taken from the deepest point and from the chlorophyll max (as it is assumed that this is where diatom-bacteria interactions are higher) and then allowed to grow on zinc-containing medium.
